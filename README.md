# Restaurant Reviews App
For this project, I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.

I took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.

I added a service worker to create an offline experience for the users.



## What I learned

- I used Flexbox techniques to make the design responsive using CSS, media queries and responsive images.
- I implemented accessibility features taking advantage of Chrome DevTools Accessibility Audits.
- I implemented offline capability using a service worker to cache visited pages.



## Requirements

Start up a simple HTTP server on port 8000 on the project folder to serve up the site files on your local computer or load the site using this link on GitHub pages https://daniele-sforza.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/
