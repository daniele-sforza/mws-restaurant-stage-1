# Restaurant Reviews App
For this project, I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.

I took take a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.

I added a service worker to create an offline experience for the users.



## What I learned

- I used Flexbox techniques to make the design responsive using CSS, media queries and responsive images.
- I implemented accessibility features taking advantage of Chrome DevTools Accessibility Audits.
- I implemented offline capability to the app using a service worker to cache visited pages.



## Requirements

All the required dependencies are included in the project.

Open `index.html` to run.
